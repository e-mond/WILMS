# WILMS

Women's Interest-Free Loan Management System (WILMS) is a TypeScript monorepo for borrower onboarding, group lending, loan lifecycle management, weekly collections, audit trails, and role-based reporting.

| **v1.3.0** | Field operations — offline PWA shell, device health, background uploads, sync conflict review, advanced lending domain |
| **v1.2.3** | Platform stabilization — invitation lifecycle, SMS delivery, UI hardening |
| **v1.2.2** | Security — session invalidation, permanent deletion, admin fee persistence |
| **v1.0.0** | Production baseline |

See `CHANGELOG.md` and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for full release history.

## Required Tooling

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm workspaces
- Railway CLI for API deploys
- Vercel CLI for frontend deploys

## First-Time Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set real credentials in `.env` or deployment secrets. Never commit `.env` files.

## Core Commands

```bash
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
npm run db:migrate -w @wilms/api
npm run smoke:production
npm run smoke:rbac
```

Production smoke requires `WILMS_APP_URL` and `WILMS_API_URL` environment variables.

## Field Operations (v1.3.0)

Collectors work in low-connectivity environments with:

- **Offline payment queue** — record collections without network; sync on reconnect
- **PWA shell** — installable app with cached navigation (`/collector/dashboard` start URL)
- **Background uploads** — photos and attachments queued in IndexedDB
- **Device health** — battery and storage monitoring in collector settings
- **Sync review** — approvers resolve offline financial operations at `/approver/sync-conflicts`
- **QR / barcode scanning** — borrower and loan lookup in the field
- **Receipt printing** — thermal-friendly text receipts

Grace periods, repayment cadences, fees, penalties, and guarantor scoring domain modules ship in v1.3.0 (see `docs/advanced-lending.md`).

## Notifications (v1.1.2+)

Outbound email from Railway uses a Vercel Gmail relay when `WILMS_VERCEL_MAIL_URL` and `WILMS_INTERNAL_MAIL_SECRET` are set on the API. Gmail credentials (`GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`) must be on Vercel. Delivery attempts are logged to `message_deliveries` and queryable via `GET /settings/delivery-logs` or the Communication Center.

## Communication Center (v1.1.3)

Super admins can access `/communication-center` to compose broadcasts, manage templates, review delivery analytics, and monitor failed messages across Email, SMS, and In-App channels.

Additional verification:

```bash
npm run verify:api-integrity
npm run verify:api-coverage
npm run verify:mock-guard
npm run verify:deploy-sync
npm run verify:empty-db
```

## Application Architecture

Production request flow:

```text
Browser UI -> Next.js /api/wilms BFF -> Railway API -> Drizzle repositories -> Neon PostgreSQL
```

The frontend service layer switches between API and mock implementations based on environment. Production must use live API mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK=false`, real API URL configured).

## Data and IDs

Business-facing screens display readable IDs such as borrower, collector, group, loan, pool, payment, and user display IDs. Raw UUIDs remain internal where required.

Ghana location data is seeded from `data/ghana-locations/` via:

```bash
npm run seed:ghana-locations
```

## Deployment

API deploy from repository root:

```bash
railway up --detach
```

Frontend deploy from repository root:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod --yes
```

See `docs/deployment-guide.md` and `docs/production-guide.md` for operational details.
